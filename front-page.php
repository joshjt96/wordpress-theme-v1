                    <h1>Tom's motivation and inspiration</h1>
                    <p>The inspiration for Tom's work
                        comes from his interaction with the world around him, and his desire to portray
                        how he experiences anything that he finds
                        interesting, beautiful or quirky. </p>
                        <p>Tom is a neurodiverse artist. His paintings reveal
                        something of the intensity experienced by many who are neurodiverse - 
                        a world that is blindingly bright and constantly moving.</p>
